# Multilayer Perceptron implementation in Pure Python (3.6+)

This project has no intent to be the fattest or useful.
It has just didactic intention.

To run the examples go:

    $ python -m examples <some_example>

At the momment they are:

- alphabet
- cubic_function 
- quadratic_function
- xor

This should be put like:
    
    $ python -m examples xor

The source files of the examples are in the folder `examples`.
